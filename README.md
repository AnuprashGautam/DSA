## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C and C++ programming languages.

### How to Use ℹ️
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-with-C-CPP.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the respective data structure or algorithm folders.
   
3. Compile the C or C++ files using an appropriate compiler.
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o output_filename        // For C files
    g++ filename.cpp -o output_filename     // For C++ files
    ```

4. Run the executable file generated.
    ```bash
    ./output_filename
    ```
