This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms in C and C++. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Contents

### Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Implementation of basic array operations.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list implementations.
- **Stacks**: Array-based and linked list-based stack implementations.
- **Queues**: Array-based and linked list-based queue implementations.
- **Trees**: Binary search trees, AVL trees, and other tree-based data structures.
- **Graphs**: Graph representations and algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, etc.

### Algorithms
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementation of various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary search, linear search, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions to dynamic programming problems.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Algorithms for traversal, shortest path, minimum spanning trees, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C and C++ programming languages.

### How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-with-C-CPP.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the respective data structure or algorithm folders.
   
3. Compile the C or C++ files using an appropriate compiler.
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o output_filename        // For C files
    g++ filename.cpp -o output_filename     // For C++ files
    ```

4. Run the executable file generated.
    ```bash
    ./output_filename
    ```
